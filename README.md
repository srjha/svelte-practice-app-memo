## Notes

### Svlte is a javascript tool for UI, just like react or angular. But the following is what makes it different and more efficient.
- It does not ship javascript runtime, rather svelte converts the code onto native so that it can run in browser.
- Svelte converts the declarative code into imparative while compiling.
- The resultant code afer compilation is small and highly performant in nature.
### Following are 3 main section which can be in a svelte file
- \<script> which can contain TS or JS
- \<style> CSS
- HTML on Steroids
